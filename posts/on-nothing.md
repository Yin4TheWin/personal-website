>*Or, why it should all be ok.*

When did you first question the meaning of existence? Think back: what was your train of thought and what conclusions did you reach? If you can provide meaningful answers to these questions, I'll take a wager on your experiences and ask you one more: how did you feel upon realizing that we are doomed to repeat the same mundane routines until we are forgotten?

### Abstract
This blog post attempts to tackle the existential crisis of being human by assuming the worst case - that life is "meaningless" - and seeing where it takes us. We'll explore three tiers of cope which may follow from this assumption, with each progressive tier building on the last.

First, I'll posit that there are small moments in life worth preserving and living for irregardless of life's meaning (ie, playing catch under a tree). Next, I'll examine the nature of these precious moments to see if there is any common thread between them, and if any shared commonality can be used to extrapolate a meaning. Finally, I'll present the ultimate cope: that accepting our life has no meaning actually opens us up to the truest freedom.

### Part One: Playing Catch As the World Caves In
>*We would just throw the ball, and catch it, and then throw it again. Just that. Over and over. There was no point to it. But it's as you say. I would've been happy just playing catch forever.*
### Part Two: Free Indeed
>*You better lose youself in the music, the moment; you own it, you better never let it go*
### Part Three: 
>*I think, therefore I am.*
